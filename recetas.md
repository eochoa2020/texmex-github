# NACHOS RECIPE

Once you have all the ingredients it's time to cook!

## STEP 1
Preheat the oven to 350Â°. In a small bowl, mix the sour cream, lime juice and chipotle puree until combined. Set the crema aside until ready to use.

## STEP 2
Arrange the chips on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle half of the cheese evenly over the chips. Top with the avocado, onion and tomato and the remaining cheese. Bake until the cheese has melted but not browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drizzle with the chipotle crema, sprinkle with cilantro and serve with Smoky Guacamole on the side.
